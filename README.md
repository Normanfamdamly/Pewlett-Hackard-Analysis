# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis - Module 7 Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help prepare the company for the upcoming "silver tsunami."  Show the managers of each department how many employees they have that are slated for retirement age, so they can plan and build out a mentoring program for the newer, less seasoned employees.  

## Results

When first queried we discovered that most of current employees who are of retirement age have moved up the ranks and received a few promotions.  So, there are quite a few duplicates in the data.  While this requires some clean up, it does show we have some very seasoned folks who could be quite useful is helping to train and possible mentor some of the lower-level employees as they move up the ranks.

## Total Retiring
The total count of retirements coming by title is where management needs to focus, as they are losing some senior employees.  So, they need to make sure they put the mentorship program in process soon and look to see if they can stagger the retirement process with added bonus' for those who wait 6 months to a year extra before retirement.

## Mentorship
The candidates available for the Mentorship Program are high quality and the company should consider them all in order to account for the large gap they need to fill.
